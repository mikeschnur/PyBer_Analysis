# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview

This analysis aimed to make a summary dataframe that displays the differnces ride sharing data by city type. This data was then shown in a line graph that presents the difference in fares by month. 

# Results
- Rural cities have the lowest total fares and least rides as well as drivers.
- Urban cities have the most highest total fares, drivers, and rides.
- Rural cities have the most expensive rides while Urban cities have the cheapest rides.
- Surburban cities fell between Urban and Rural cities in every category.

# Suggestions
1. Allocate more drivers to Suburban and Rural areas, because the Rides to Drivers ratio is much higher in Rural and Suburban areas than Urban.
2. Adjust prices based on weeks or days when travel may be increased (Christmas, Thanksgiving).
3. Create one-time discount for people in Rural areas to increase in the amount of rides while still keeping the Average Fare consistent with other areas.
